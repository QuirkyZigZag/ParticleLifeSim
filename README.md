A scuffed particle simulator that I made for my NEA in computing. Didn't quite get the behaviours I wanted but it works well enough 


Implemented a proper project structure, and ECS, applied Quadtrees and other optimisation techniques. Got a better understanding of SDL2 and it's documentation

When running the application after compiling and building the project just press h for the help menu to open up in the terminal which will give a list of the keys you can press to manipulate the sim


Entire project took about a week + a lot of testing and adjusting. The write up took much longer
